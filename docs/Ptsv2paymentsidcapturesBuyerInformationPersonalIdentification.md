## Extensibility

This model derives from `ExtensibleModel`, so it can round-trip JSON fields that are not (yet) defined as typed properties above:

- `SetExtraField(string jsonName, object value)` &mdash; set a field that is not mapped to a property.
- `GetExtraField<T>(string jsonName)` / `TryGetExtraField<T>(string jsonName, out T value)` &mdash; read an unmapped field.

Unknown fields received in a response are preserved and re-serialized on the next request. Setting the same field both as a typed property and via `SetExtraField` throws at serialization time (serialize-time conflict guard).
