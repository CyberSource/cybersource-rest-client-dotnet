# CyberSource.Model.Ptsv2paymentsIssuerInformation
## Properties

Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**DiscretionaryData** | **string** | Data defined by the issuer.  The value for this reply field will probably be the same as the value that you submitted in the authorization request, but it is possible for the processor, issuer, or acquirer to modify the value.  This field is supported only for Visa transactions on **CyberSource through VisaNet**.  | [optional] 

## Extensibility

This model derives from `ExtensibleModel`, so it can round-trip JSON fields that are not (yet) defined as typed properties above:

- `SetExtraField(string jsonName, object value)` &mdash; set a field that is not mapped to a property.
- `GetExtraField<T>(string jsonName)` / `TryGetExtraField<T>(string jsonName, out T value)` &mdash; read an unmapped field.

Unknown fields received in a response are preserved and re-serialized on the next request. Setting the same field both as a typed property and via `SetExtraField` throws at serialization time (serialize-time conflict guard).
