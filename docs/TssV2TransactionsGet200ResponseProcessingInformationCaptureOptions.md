# CyberSource.Model.TssV2TransactionsGet200ResponseProcessingInformationCaptureOptions
## Properties

Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**TotalCaptureCount** | **int?** | Total number of captures when requesting multiple partial captures for one payment. Used along with &#x60;captureSequenceNumber&#x60; field to track which capture is being processed.  For example, the second of five captures would be passed to CyberSource as:   - &#x60;captureSequenceNumber &#x3D; 2&#x60;, and   - &#x60;totalCaptureCount &#x3D; 5&#x60;  | [optional] 
**CaptureSequenceNumber** | **int?** | Capture number when requesting multiple partial captures for one authorization. Used along with &#x60;totalCaptureCount&#x60; to track which capture is being processed.  For example, the second of five captures would be passed to CyberSource as:   - &#x60;captureSequenceNumber_ &#x3D; 2&#x60;, and   - &#x60;totalCaptureCount &#x3D; 5&#x60;  | [optional] 

## Extensibility

This model derives from `ExtensibleModel`, so it can round-trip JSON fields that are not (yet) defined as typed properties above:

- `SetExtraField(string jsonName, object value)` &mdash; set a field that is not mapped to a property.
- `GetExtraField<T>(string jsonName)` / `TryGetExtraField<T>(string jsonName, out T value)` &mdash; read an unmapped field.

Unknown fields received in a response are preserved and re-serialized on the next request. Setting the same field both as a typed property and via `SetExtraField` throws at serialization time (serialize-time conflict guard).
