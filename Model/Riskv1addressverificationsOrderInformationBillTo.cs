CyberSource through VisaNet accepts and stores non-ASCII characters correctly and displays them correctly in reports. However, the limitations of the credit card networks prevent CyberSource through VisaNet from transmitting non-ASCII characters to the credit card networks. Therefore, CyberSource through VisaNet replaces non-ASCII characters with meaningless ASCII characters for transmission to the credit card networks.  #### FDMS Nashville Required if &#x60;pointOfSaleInformation.entryMode&#x3D;keyed&#x60; and the address is in the U.S. or Canada.
