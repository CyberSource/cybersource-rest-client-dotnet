## Properties

Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**Number** | **string** | Account number.  When processing encoded account numbers, use this field for the encoded account number.  | [optional] 
**Iban** | **string** | International Bank Account Number (IBAN) for the bank account. For some countries you can provide this number instead of the traditional bank account information. You can use this field only when scoring a direct debit transaction.  | [optional] 

## Extensibility

This model derives from `ExtensibleModel`, so it can round-trip JSON fields that are not (yet) defined as typed properties above:

- `SetExtraField(string jsonName, object value)` &mdash; set a field that is not mapped to a property.
- `GetExtraField<T>(string jsonName)` / `TryGetExtraField<T>(string jsonName, out T value)` &mdash; read an unmapped field.

Unknown fields received in a response are preserved and re-serialized on the next request. Setting the same field both as a typed property and via `SetExtraField` throws at serialization time (serialize-time conflict guard).
